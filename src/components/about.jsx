          <p>Hi, I'm Kyle!</p>
          <p>
            I'm a Junior Full-stack Developer based in the Chester (UK) area.
            After years in a career which I was good at, but in which I never
            felt I belonged, I took the plunge into this wondrous coding
            adventure! I love creating awesome things with tech. Check out some
            of my work below and, if you like what you see, or want to hire me
            ðŸ˜‰, let me know.
          </p>
          <p>
            Likes: Writing Code, Playing guitar, Singing, Learning new things,
            Pushing my limits, The occasional cookie...
          </p>
          <p>Loves: My family</p>
          <p>Dislikes: Negativity (is that ironic?), Admitting defeat...</p>
